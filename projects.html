          <p>
            This was an intership project <br><br>
            This project describes a wheelchair for physically disabled people. The goal is to design and develop a system that allows the user to robustly interact with the wheelchair at different levels of the control and sensing. <br><br> A dependent-user recognition using finger movements and infrared sensor integrated with wheelchair. Wheelchair which can be driven using DC Driver Motor with separate power supply and finger Movements with the possibility of avoiding obstacles by using obstacles sensors.<br><br>
            Note: This was prototype model that we built to showcase our idea to client

            This was also an IOT based project which involves extending connectivity beyond standard devices such as  desktops, laptops, smart phones which is Embedded with the technology, these devices make communication over the internet and user can remotely monitor them & controll them using an app intalled in user's smart phone

          <p>
            Home appliances system made form vb.net with the database of MS ACCESS <br><br>
            This project was built in the framwork Microsoft Visual Studio 2010. It was an small project containing information about daily transaction a small scale business goes through. <br><br>
            it holds the records like purchase, sales, stock at hand, stock which is going to be sold on a particular day, cutomers record/information, employees records/details etc. <br><br>
            It has database of MS Access. We had connected that database to the front-end using in-built services from MS Visual studio 2010. This database basically had tables associated with each forms  and tables has fields associated with fields in the form. In this way the entered record/information gets stores at their intended location. <br> This app was able to generate reports whenever required. This service was available only for the internal employees.

          <div class="text"> TextUtils </div> <br> <br>

          <p>
            This project was actually my first React app I made. This simple web app can do text manipulation like character counter, remove extra spaces from text capitalize and vice cersa and preview text. <br> <br>
            This app comes with beautiful light mode and dark mode. In dark mode the text are white woth some changes in background color. <br><br>
            There is another page in this web app called about us which explains the methodolgy I've used for e.g. use of states & props, use of Router etc. while developing this web app. The switching between the pages is actually done by Router which switch the one component to another, which makes it really fast.

          <p>
            “Turtle” is a Python feature like a drawing board, which lets us command a turtle to draw all over it! We can use functions like turtle.forward() and turtle.right() which can move the turtle around. <br><br> Usin this functionality I created word "maa" which represents mother with the help of web. <br><br>
