              <b>Finger Controlled Wheel-Chair using Arduino & Flex sensor: </b> <br/><br/>
              In order to use or operate this wheelchair user to wear a hand gloves on which flex sensors was attached, as person wearing those gloves bending his finger a signal gets sent to relay motors through Arduino board and wheels used to spin accordingly. An Obstacle sensor also were attached to wheel chair along with power source to charge batteries connected to this mechanism.

<!-- 
My skills & Experiences 
Since my academic projects I was always intrested in designing, due to that I found HTML & CSS intresting and then started designing web pages like this one. I also know databases like Oracle & MySQL, and I know how to perform the basic queries as well. I know the core Java & basics of python.  Additionally, I have recently developed intrest in front-end designing & I am also learning the same from Udemy as well.

Experiences
